# CH21-Book-Search-Engine
MERN Challenge

## Description
TO take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Usage
I wasn't able to deploy the application: https://immense-ocean-68764.herokuapp.com/
